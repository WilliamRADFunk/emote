# emote
(In Progress) A full stack MMO 2D game with an entirely javascript engine...and HTML5 Canvas
<br/>
## Instructions (for now):
<br/>
### Left mouse button has player orb chase mouse pointer.
<br/>
### Space bar activates temporary emote cloud, which fades over time.
<br/>
## Purpose:
<br/>
An MMO without speech or text that requires players to communicate with each other 
through visible (colors) emotes. Players can build structures from dense "emote residue," 
and fight off a larger unseen threat with tactics and team work.
<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, white orb bots consume emote residue in small amounts, can be consumed by 
players (and larger threat), and can learn from observing other bots who have survived longer.
<br/>
<br/>
Successful completion of puzzles and/or defeat of larger threat may lead to level escalation for
that server and its inhabitants.

# emote
(In Progress) A full stack MMO 2D game with an entirely javascript engine...and HTML5 Canvas
<br/>
## Instructions (for now):

### Left mouse button has player orb chase mouse pointer.

### Space bar activates temporary emote cloud, which fades over time.

## Purpose:

An MMO without speech or text that requires players to communicate with each other 
through visible (colors) emotes. Players can build structures from dense "emote residue," 
and fight off a larger unseen threat with tactics and team work.
<br/>
Meanwhile, white orb bots consume emote residue in small amounts, can be consumed by 
players (and larger threat), and can learn from observing other bots who have survived longer.
<br/>
Successful completion of puzzles and/or defeat of larger threat may lead to level escalation for
that server and its inhabitants.

## Tools:

### Front-End: HTML5 Canvas, CSS3, and Javascript.
